  ## Origin of Magical Symbols

  Magical symbols, as known today, can be dated back to Arabic translations of Greek translations of Egyptian papyrus scrolls. While translating into greek, the Greek used letters of their alphabet with added circles to differentiate between symbols with and without magical meaning. Through the ages the amount of circles per symbol increased.

  In that sense these symbols are used similarly to the way how symbols are used in mathematics: You can declare that a specific symbols has a specific meaning and then continue using said symbol as a sort of abbreviation. This means that the symbol itself has no magical power, it just denotes a magical concept.
