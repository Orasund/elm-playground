  # Technical Paper Regarding the Construction of Sigils
  
  Sigils are symbols with an encoded meanings. While historically the different types of sigils are well known, its construction is sometimes missing. Here we present a collection of different types of sigil and different possible methods for constructing them.

  ## Origin of Magical Symbols

  Magical symbols, as known today, can be dated back to Arabic translations of Greek translations of Egyptian papyrus scrolls. While translating into greek, the Greek used letters of their alphabet with added circles to differentiate between symbols with and without magical meaning. Through the ages the amount of circles per symbol increased.

  In that sense these symbols are used similarly to the way how symbols are used in mathematics: You can declare that a specific symbols has a specific meaning and then continue using said symbol as a sort of abbreviation. This means that the symbol itself has no magical power, it just denotes a magical concept.

  ## Early Sigils

  In the Kabbalah we see new forms of magical symbols that are not related to greek letters. They are composed out of straight lines with circles on their ends. It seems like they had or have a specific underlying construction that have been lost during translation.

  ## Sigils by Austin Osman Spare

  Over time the methods for constructing sigils got more and more corrupted. An artist and occultist called Austin Osman Spare therefore came up with a more simpler construction. By his method one arranges the letters of the word in question into a unique gylth without using any technical methods.
