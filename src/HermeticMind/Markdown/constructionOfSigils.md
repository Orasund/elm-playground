# Technical Paper Regarding the Construction of Sigils
  
Sigils are symbols with an encoded meanings. While historically the different types of sigils are well known, its construction is sometimes missing. Here we present a collection of different types of sigil and different possible methods for constructing them.

## History of Sigils

### Origin of Magical Symbols

Magical symbols, as known today, can be dated back to Arabic translations of Greek translations of Egyptian papyrus scrolls. While translating into greek, the Greek used letters of their alphabet with added circles to differentiate between symbols with and without magical meaning. Through the ages the amount of circles per symbol increased. (See [Magical Symbols - History of Sigils Angelic Alphabets and Symbols of Power by ESOTERICA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dhz4GR2yio))

In that sense these symbols are used similarly to the way how symbols are used in mathematics: You can declare that a specific symbols has a specific meaning and then continue using said symbol as a sort of abbreviation. This means that the symbol itself has no magical power, it just denotes a magical concept.

### Early Sigils

In the Kabbalah we see new forms of magical symbols that are not related to greek letters. They are composed out of straight lines with circles on their ends. It seems like they had or have a specific underlying construction that have been lost during translation.

### Sigils by Austin Osman Spare

Over time the methods for constructing sigils got more and more corrupted. An artist and occultist called Austin Osman Spare therefore came up with a more simpler construction. By his method one arranges the letters of the word in question into a unique gylth without using any technical methods.

## Construction

### Construction using Attributes

One way for constructing such sigils is by first spacially arranging concepts and then connecting concepts that the sigil should represent. As an example we can construct symbols for the 4 elements by connecting the respective qualities (See [Aristotilean Qualities of Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element#Greece))

### Construction using Magic Squares

A common way for medieval sigils was to use a magic square. (See Magic Squares) One first transforming the letters of a word into numbers. (See Gematria for transforming jewish words) Next one connects the corresponding fields in the magic square, resulting in a symbol. Typically, a magic square of degree 3 is used and by computing the remainder of the division by 9 one can get a mapping from the alphabet to the fields of the square.

### Construction using a Circle

One can first arrange the letters of the alphabets around a circle. Next all letters of the respective word are connected by a continues line.
